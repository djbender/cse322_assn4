To test your Prolog files:

1. First, ensure that your Prolog files have the expected names: assn4_part1.pl
and assn4_part2.pl

2. Run 'pl' from the shell.

3. Enter '[testcases].' into the interpreter.

4. To run the Xth test on part Y, enter 'mainXpartY.'  Enter a semicolon (;)
until no more bindings are found.

5. To verify accuracy, check the results you obtained against the appropriate
output file. Look in the outputs/ directory and check the file testX_partY.txt
to find the expected output for test number X, part Y.  Remember, order is not
important for correctness.
